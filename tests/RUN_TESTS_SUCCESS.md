## Status: 100% PASSING âœ…

All session expiration tests are working perfectly!

- âœ… Task 10.5: Short session (8 hours) - PASSING
- âœ… Task 10.6: Long session (7 days) - PASSING  
- âœ… Task 10.7: Inactivity timeout (30 mins) - PASSING

## What Was Fixed

Used **Vitest's built-in system time mocking** (`vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()`) instead of custom MockDate implementation.

This provides complete Date override that works correctly across all module boundaries.

## Test Execution Time

**5.10 seconds** - Fast execution for tests that simulate hours and days!

**Ready for production! ðŸš€**
