## Implementation Notes

### Database First Approach
Start with Task 1.0 (Database Schema) as all other features depend on it. Test the migration thoroughly before proceeding.

### Authentication Isolation
Customer authentication is completely separate from staff authentication. Use different context providers and session tables.

### Progressive Implementation
Follow the task order - build foundation (auth, database) before features (ordering, payments). Each task builds on previous ones.

### Testing Strategy
Test each major feature as it's completed. Don't wait until the end to test. Use the test environment throughout development.

### Mobile-First Design
All customer-facing components must be designed mobile-first since 60%+ of customers will use mobile devices.

### Security Considerations
Implement security measures (rate limiting, validation, RLS) as features are built, not as an afterthought.

### Owner vs Cashier Access
Carefully implement role checks:
- **Owner only**: Product catalog management, order holds, pickup time configuration, sending quotes
- **Owner & Cashier**: Viewing orders, updating order status, payment verification, notifications

### Payment Integration
Set up Stripe test mode first. Test the complete payment flow before configuring production keys.

### SMS Integration
Use test mode (console logging) during development. Configure actual SMS webhook only when ready for staging/production testing.

**Total Sub-tasks**: 426 detailed implementation steps across 12 major feature areas.

**Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for a junior developer (depending on experience with React, Supabase, and payment integrations).

**Priority Order**: Follow task numbering 1.0 → 12.0 for logical dependency flow.
