# Task List: Inventory Management System

**Based on**: `0001-prd-inventory-management.md`  
**Generated**: 2025-10-10

---

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Codebase
- **Architecture**: Single `App.jsx` component (~970 lines) with all business logic
- **Database**: Supabase with tables: `products` (id, name, price, is_weight_based), `bills` (flat structure)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Existing Features**: User roles (guest/cashier/owner), product CRUD, cart management, bill generation, sales reports

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/App.jsx` - Main application logic
- `src/config/supabase.js` - Database client
- Database schema (via Supabase)

---
