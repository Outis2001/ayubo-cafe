## 🎓 Technical Details

### How Netlify Functions Work

**Traditional Server:**
```
Browser → Server (always running) → Database/Email
         ↑
    Needs maintenance, costs $$$
```

**Netlify Functions (Serverless):**
```
Browser → Netlify Function (runs on-demand) → Email
         ↑
    No maintenance, FREE
```

**Benefits:**
- No server to maintain
- Pay only for usage (first 125k calls FREE)
- Auto-scaling
- Always up-to-date
