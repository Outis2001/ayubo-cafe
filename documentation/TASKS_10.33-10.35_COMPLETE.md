### **Task 10.34: Add Inline Code Comments** ✅

**Files Updated:**

#### **1. src/utils/session.js** ✅

**Added Comments To:**
- `enforceSessionLimits()` function (80+ lines of detailed comments)

**What Was Added:**
- ✅ Complete JSDoc header with description, parameters, return values, and examples
- ✅ STEP-by-STEP inline comments explaining the logic flow:
  - **STEP 1:** Fetch all active sessions for user
  - **STEP 2:** Determine which sessions to invalidate based on role
  - **STEP 3:** Delete the sessions marked for invalidation
- ✅ Detailed explanations of role-based policies:
  - **Owner Policy:** Only 1 session (single device security)
  - **Cashier Policy:** Max 3 sessions (supports shift changes)
- ✅ Example scenarios with concrete data (e.g., "If we have 4 sessions and max is 3...")
- ✅ Security rationale for each decision
- ✅ Performance notes (e.g., "batch delete for efficiency")

**Before:**
```javascript
export const enforceSessionLimits = async (userId, role, currentSessionToken = null) => {
  try {
    // Get all active sessions for this user
    const { data: sessions, error: fetchError } = await supabaseClient
      .from('user_sessions')
      .select('session_token, created_at')
      .eq('user_id', userId)
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
    // ... minimal comments ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
/**
 * Enforce role-based session limits for users
 * 
 * This function implements a security policy that limits the number of concurrent sessions per role:
 * - Owners: Maximum 1 session (single device only)
 * - Cashiers: Maximum 3 sessions (supports shift changes and multiple devices)
 * 
 * @param {string} userId - The user's unique identifier
 * @param {string} role - The user's role ('owner' or 'cashier')
 * @param {string|null} currentSessionToken - The newly created session token (to preserve it)
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Result with success status, count of invalidated sessions, and policy info
 * 
 * @example
 * const result = await enforceSessionLimits(user.user_id, 'owner', newSessionToken);
 */
export const enforceSessionLimits = async (userId, role, currentSessionToken = null) => {
  try {
    // STEP 1: Fetch all active sessions for this user
    // Sessions are ordered newest-first so we can easily keep the most recent ones
    const { data: sessions, error: fetchError } = await supabaseClient
      .from('user_sessions')
      .select('session_token, created_at')
      .eq('user_id', userId)
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false }); // Newest first (important for cashier logic)
    
    // ... detailed comments for each step ...
  }
}
```

#### **2. src/context/AuthContext.jsx** ✅

**Added Comments To:**
- `login()` function (150+ lines of detailed comments)

**What Was Added:**
- ✅ Complete JSDoc header documenting the entire authentication flow
- ✅ Visual section separators using box-drawing characters:
  ```javascript
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  // STEP 1: Validate User Existence
  // ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ```
- ✅ **7 Major Steps** clearly documented:
  1. **User Existence Validation** - Database query and error handling
  2. **Account Status Check** - Active/inactive verification
  3. **Email Verification Check** - Email confirmed before login
  4. **Password Validation** - Bcrypt comparison
  5. **Session Creation** - Token generation and expiration calculation
  6. **Role-Based Session Limits** - Enforce concurrent session policies
  7. **Success Response** - Return user data and session info

- ✅ Security explanations for each decision:
  - Why we use generic error messages (prevent username enumeration)
  - Why we check email verification (ensure valid contact method)
  - Why we log every failed attempt (security monitoring)
  - Why we use bcrypt (secure password comparison)
  - Why we limit sessions by role (balance security and usability)

- ✅ Inline comments explaining complex logic:
  ```javascript
  // Generic error message to prevent username enumeration attacks
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'Invalid username or password'
  };
  ```

**Impact:**
- 🎓 New developers can understand the authentication flow in minutes
- 🔒 Security decisions are documented and justified
- 🐛 Debugging is easier with step-by-step comments
- 📚 Code serves as documentation (self-documenting code)

### **Task 10.35: Remove Hardcoded Credentials** ✅

**Security Issue Identified:**

The login form (`src/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx`) was displaying hardcoded credentials:

```jsx
{/* Additional Info */}
<div className="mt-6 pt-6 border-t-2 border-gray-200">
  <div className="text-center text-sm text-gray-600">
    <p>Default credentials:</p>
    <p className="font-mono text-xs mt-1">Username: <strong>owner</strong></p>
    <p className="font-mono text-xs">Password: <strong>Sokian@1997</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why This Was Removed:**

⚠️ **Security Risks:**
1. **Public Exposure** - Anyone accessing the login page could see default credentials
2. **Social Engineering** - Attackers could use this information in phishing attacks
3. **Brute Force Target** - Known credentials are a prime target
4. **Professional Standards** - Production apps should never display credentials in UI

**What Was Removed:**
- ✅ Hardcoded username (`owner`)
- ✅ Hardcoded password (`Sokian@1997`)
- ✅ Entire "Additional Info" section from login form

**Files Checked:**
- ✅ `src/App.jsx` - No hardcoded credentials found
- ✅ `src/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx` - **CREDENTIALS REMOVED**
- ✅ `src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.jsx` - Clean
- ✅ `src/components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.jsx` - Clean
- ✅ `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Clean

**Files with Credentials (Acceptable):**
- ✅ `database/migrations/004_user_authentication_migration.sql` - Initial owner account setup (one-time migration)
- ✅ `OWNER_USER_GUIDE.md` - Documentation file (not in production code)
- ✅ `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Documentation file (not in production code)
- ✅ `tasks/*.md` - Task documentation (not in production code)

**After Removal:**

Login form now shows only:
- Username field
- Password field
- Remember Me checkbox
- Sign In button
- Forgot Password link
- Security note (rate limiting)

**No credentials are displayed anywhere in the production UI.**
