# ðŸš€ How to Run Session Expiration Tests

## Quick Start (1 minute)

### Run Tasks 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 Tests

```bash
npm run test:session
```

That's it! This will test all three session expiration scenarios in under 1 second.

## What You'll See

```
> ayubo-cafe@1.0.0 test:session
> vitest run tests/integration/session-expiration.test.js

 âœ“ Task 10.6: Long session expiration (7 days)
   âœ“ should expire long session after 7 days
   âœ“ should validate long session within 7 day window
   âœ“ should NOT apply inactivity timeout to long sessions

 âœ“ Task 10.7: Inactivity timeout (30 minutes)
   âœ“ should expire short session after 30 minutes of inactivity
   âœ“ should maintain session with activity updates within 30 minutes
   âœ“ should calculate correct minutes of inactivity
   âœ“ should expire by inactivity before absolute timeout

## All Available Commands

| Command | What It Does | When To Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run all tests in watch mode | During development |
| `npm run test:run` | Run all tests once | For quick checks |
| `npm run test:session` | Run only session tests | To test tasks 10.5-10.7 |
| `npm run test:ui` | Open visual test UI | For debugging |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate coverage report | To see test coverage |

---

## Interactive UI Mode

For the best experience, run:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This opens a browser at `http://localhost:51204` where you can:
- âœ… See test results visually
- âœ… Click on tests to see details
- âœ… Debug failing tests
- âœ… Re-run tests instantly
- âœ… View code coverage

## Understanding the Tests

### Task 10.5: 8 Hour Session Expiration
**What it tests:** Sessions without "remember me" expire after 8 hours

```javascript
// Test instantly jumps 8 hours into the future
mockDate.advanceHours(8);
expect(session.isValid).toBe(false);
```

**Run time:** ~10 milliseconds (instead of 8 hours!)

---

### Task 10.6: 7 Day Session Expiration
**What it tests:** Sessions with "remember me" expire after 7 days

```javascript
// Test instantly jumps 7 days into the future
mockDate.advanceDays(7);
expect(session.isValid).toBe(false);
```

**Run time:** ~10 milliseconds (instead of 7 days!)

---

### Task 10.7: 30 Minute Inactivity
**What it tests:** Short sessions expire after 30 minutes of no activity

```javascript
// Test instantly jumps 30 minutes into the future
mockDate.advanceMinutes(30);
expect(session.isValid).toBe(false);
expect(session.expiration_reason).toBe('inactivity');
```

**Run time:** ~10 milliseconds (instead of 30 minutes!)

## Troubleshooting

### Tests not running?
```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Try running again
npm run test:session
```

### Want to see more detail?
```bash
# Run in UI mode for visual debugging
npm run test:ui
```

### Tests failing?
Check `tests/SUMMARY.md` for known issues and solutions.
